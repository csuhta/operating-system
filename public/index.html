      <h2>Data</h2>

      <p>
        All attempts have been made to present data as honestly and transparently as possible.
        All aggregated data has been matched with a corresponding Data Accuracy Meter score.
      </p>

      <h3>Sample Data Sets</h3>

      <p>
        The following sample data is available for your consideration:

      </a>

      <p>
        *This is a tad tricky. If the Google Latitude data doesn't load on your first try, try page again. Open up in your phone browser, as able, not any Google Maps apps. If prompted, you do NOT need to give Google
        your current location.
      </p>

      <h3>DAM Scores</h3>
      
      <p>All computed data featured inside of Operating System is matched to a corresponding Data Accuracy Meter (DAM) score out of 100. The higher the DAM score, the more reliable the data is.</p> This is our best attempt at personal statistical significance and personal transparency.
      
      <p>DAM scores are calculated via the following formula:</p>

      <p>
        Let <i>t</i> = total possible data set, <i>t</i> &gt; 0; <br>
        <i>a</i> = available data, 0 ≤ <i>a</i> ≤ <i>t</i>;<br>
        <i>c</i> = subjective confidence, 0 ≤ <i>c</i> ≤ 10;<br>
        <i>s</i> = subjective sensitivity, 0 ≤ <i>s</i> ≤ 10.
      </p>

      <p>The subjective accuracy of the data is then equal to:</p>

      <img src="/assets/images/latext.png" alt="the mathmatical formula [(a^3/t^3)-3(a^2/t^2)+3(a/t)]*log(0.9c+1)*(1-0.03s^2+0.002s^3)">
